# Privacy Policy for Sari Scan

**Last Updated: February 12, 2026**

## Introduction

This privacy policy describes how Sari Scan ("we", "our", or "the app") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application.

Sari Scan is a barcode scanning app designed for sari-sari stores (small retail shops) in the Philippines to manage product prices through barcode scanning.

## Information We Collect

### Camera Access
The app requires camera access to scan product barcodes. The camera is used exclusively for:
- Reading barcode information from products
- Displaying a live camera preview during scanning

**Important:** We do NOT:
- Store or transmit any photos or videos
- Use the camera for any purpose other than barcode scanning
- Share camera data with third parties

### Local Data Storage
The app stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

1. **Product Information**
   - Product names
   - Product prices
   - Product barcodes
   - This data is stored in a local SQLite database on your device

2. **App Preferences**
   - Theme mode selection (light/dark/system)
   - Language preference (English/Cebuano)
   - This data is stored using local device storage

## How We Use Your Information

All data collected by Sari Scan is used exclusively for the app's core functionality:

- Providing the app interface in your preferred language and theme

## Data Storage and Security

- **All data is stored locally** on your device in a local SQLite database
- **No data is transmitted** over the internet or to any external servers
- **No cloud backup** is performed by the app
- Your data remains on your device and is only accessible by the app

## Third-Party Services

## Children's Privacy

Sari Scan does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. The app is designed for business use in retail stores.

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

- **Camera Permission**: Required to scan product barcodes. This permission is essential for the app's core functionality.
- **Storage Permission**: Required to store product data and app preferences locally on your device.

You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device's settings, but this will prevent the app from functioning properly.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:
- You can delete all app data by uninstalling the app
- You can clear app data through your device's system settings
- You can manually delete individual products within the app
