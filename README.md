# Sari-Sari Store Price Scanner (WIP)

Built using flutter but for android mobile device.

An android mobile application for determining the price of the products from the barcode. It aims to aid small scale business like sari-sari store for tracking and managing prices of products at their fingertips.

## To-Do Features

- [ ] Use camera to detect barcode and redirect to price result or product screen.
- [ ] Display list of products. 
- [ ] Register product along with price option when a barcode does not exist in local storage.
- [ ] Manage the products and prices screen.
- [ ] Export and import file for backup and restore data.
- [ ] (Optional and is only for convenience) Standalone static website for managing the products and prices, without backend. Utilizes import and export file. The exported file will be used to import in android application. 

## Limitations

It relies on barcode and is not for products without barcode such as eggs, onion, garlic, and etc. 🤪
